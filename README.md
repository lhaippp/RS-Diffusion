Multi-GPU training can be simply set up by using the following commands:
```
# First, configure the Accelerator on your own machine
accelerate config

# Then, launch your training
accelerate launch train_RS_real.py --config config/RS_real_config.yaml
```

### Testing
You can check the state of a diffusion model during training by:
```
python sample_RS_real.py --config config/RS_real_config_teat.yaml
```
